### **Creational design patterns**

Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

**Singleton** is a creational design pattern, which ensures that only one object of its kind exists and provides a single point of access to it for any other code. Singleton has almost the same pros and cons as global variables. Although they’re super-handy, they break the modularity of your code and it could be implemented as follows:

```typescript
namespace SingletonPattern {
    export class Singleton {
        private static _instance: Singleton;

        private constructor() {}

        public static getInstance(): Singleton {
            if (!Singleton._instance) {
                Singleton._instance = new Singleton();
            }
            return Singleton._instance;
        }
    }
}
```

**Builder** is a creational design pattern, which allows constructing complex objects step by step. Unlike other creational patterns, Builder doesn’t require products to have a common interface. That makes it possible to produce different products using the same construction process. It could be implemented as follows:

```typescript
namespace BuilderPattern {
    export class RestaurantBuilder {
        private readonly name: string;
        private address: string;

        constructor(name: string) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        get Name() {
            return this.name;
        }

        setAddress(val: string) {
            this.address = val;
            return this;
        }

        get Address() {
            return this.address;
        }

        // ... other attributes
        
        build(): Restaurant {
            return new Restaurant(this);
        }
    }

    export class Restaurant {
        private readonly name: string;
        private readonly address: string;
        private readonly rating: number;
        private readonly cooksNo: number;
        private readonly waitersNo: number;

        constructor(builder: RestaurantBuilder) {
            this.name = builder.Name;
            this.address = builder.Address;
            this.rating = builder.Rating;
            this.cooksNo = builder.CooksNo;
            this.waitersNo = builder.WaitersNo;
        }

        get Name() {
            return this.name;
        }
        // ... other attributes
    }
}
```

**Factory method** is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes. Factory Method defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of direct constructor call (`new` operator). Subclasses can override this method to change the class of objects that will be created. It could be implemented as follows:

```typescript
namespace FactoryMethodPattern {

    /***
     * Types of food in our Food factory
     * */
    export enum FoodTypesEnum {
        MEAT = 'MEAT',
        VEGETABLE = 'VEGETABLE'
    }

    /***
     * Abstract interface of a concrete product (food) from our factory
     * */
    export interface IFood {
        name: string;
        preparationTime: number;
        type: FoodTypesEnum;

        prepare(args?: any): void;
    }

    /***
     * The method on both Concrete products will do the same thing, so we can use inheritance
     * where Food class implements the Abstract product (IFood)
     * */
    export class Food implements IFood {
        name: string;
        preparationTime: number;
        type: FoodTypesEnum;

        constructor(name: string, time: number, type: FoodTypesEnum) {
            this.name = name;
            this.preparationTime = time;
            this.type = type;
        }

        prepare(args?: any): void {
            console.log(`${this.type} Food: ${this.name} was prepared in: ${this.preparationTime} time units.`);
        }
    }

    /***
     * Concrete products
     * */
    export class VegetableFood extends Food {
        constructor(name: string, time: number, type: FoodTypesEnum) {
            super(name, time, type);
        }
    }

    export class MeatFood extends Food {
        constructor(name: string, time: number, type: FoodTypesEnum) {
            super(name, time, type);
        }
    }

    /***
     * Our Food Factory
     * */
    export namespace FoodFactory {
        export const createFood = (type: FoodTypesEnum, name: string, time: number) => {
            switch (type) {
                case FactoryMethodPattern.FoodTypesEnum.MEAT: {
                    return new MeatFood(name, time, type);
                }
                case FoodTypesEnum.VEGETABLE: {
                    return new VegetableFood(name, time, type);
                }
                default: {
                    throw new Error(`No such food type: ${type}`);
                }
            }
        };
    }
}
```



### **Structural design patterns**

In software engineering, the Structural Design Patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Structural class patterns use inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes/abstractions, but the structural object patterns use composition which is generally a more flexible alternative to inheritance.

**Facade** is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework and it could be implemented as follows:

```typescript
namespace FacadePattern {
    export interface IShape {
        draw(): string;
    }

    class Square implements IShape {
        public draw(): string {
            return 'square - ⬜';
        }
    }

    class Circle implements IShape {
        public draw(): string {
            return 'circle - ◯';
        }
    }

    export class ShapeFacade {
        private circle: Circle;
        private square: Square;

        constructor() {
            this.circle = new Circle();
            this.square = new Square();
        }

        public drawCircle(): string {
            return this.circle.draw();
        }

        public drawSquare(): string {
            return this.square.draw();
        }
        
        // ... other facade parts methods
    }

}
```

**Adapter** is a structural design pattern, which allows incompatible objects to collaborate. The Adapter acts as a wrapper between two objects. It catches calls for one object and transforms them to format and interface recognizable by the second object. It could be implemented as follows:

```typescript
namespace AdapterPattern {
    export interface ITarget {
        getMessage(): string;
    }

    export class Target implements ITarget {
        getMessage(): string {
            return 'Default message from Target class';
        }
    }

    export class Adaptee {
        public getAdapteeMessage() {
            return 'Message from adaptee: zdarova';
        }
    }

    export class Adapter extends Target {
        private _adaptee: Adaptee;

        constructor(adaptee: Adaptee) {
            super();
            this._adaptee = adaptee;
        }

        public getMessage(): string {
            const result = this._adaptee.getAdapteeMessage().toUpperCase()
            return `Adapter Upper case message: ${result}`
        }
    }
}
```

**Proxy** is a structural design pattern that provides an object that acts as a substitute for a real service object used by a client. A proxy receives client requests, does some work (access control, caching, etc.) and then passes the request to a service object. It could be implemented as follows:

```typescript
namespace ProxyPattern {

    export interface IService {
        getUserData(params?: any): void;
    }

    /***
     * Real subject (service) the proxy will redirect to
     * */
    export class SensitiveUserService implements IService {
        getUserData() {
            return {'username': 'nichitaa', 'password': 'strongPassword', 'university': 'UTM'};
        }
    }

    /***
     * Proxy with simple auth / load balance / caching
     * */
    export class Proxy implements IService {
        private readonly proxyName: string;
        private userService: SensitiveUserService;
        private limit: number; // max number of requests
        private cachedData: any;

        constructor(name: string) {
            this.proxyName = name;
            this.userService = new SensitiveUserService();
            this.limit = 2;
            this.cachedData = null;
        }

        getUserData(authToken: string) {
            if (this.checkAuth(authToken)) {
                if (this.loadBalance()) {
                    if (this.cache()) {
                        // all checks have passed, do redirect to the real service
                        this.cachedData = this.userService.getUserData();
                        return this.cachedData;
                    } else {
                        return this.cachedData;
                    }
                } else {
                    return `[${this.proxyName}] No more available requests`;
                }
            } else {
                return `[${this.proxyName}] Not Authorized`;
            }
        }

        cache() {
            return !this.cachedData;
        }

        loadBalance() {
            if (this.limit === 0) return false;
            else {
                this.limit--;
                return true;
            }
        }

        checkAuth(token: string) {
            return token === 'securedToken';
        }
    }
}
```
